The dataset is stored in an Excel file, with each row representing a set of six distinct numerical values.

These values are distributed across six individual columns, with each column containing one of the numbers.

The initial row in the dataset corresponds to the most recently added set of six values.

The aim is to predict the subsequent set of six numbers that could potentially constitute a new row in the dataset.
